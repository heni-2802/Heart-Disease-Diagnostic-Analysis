## Project Overview
Health is real wealth, and the pandemic has highlighted the importance of understanding health data. This project analyzes heart disease diagnostic data using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and Python for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). The analysis focuses on heart disease rates by gender and age, along with other key metrics. A Power BI dashboard visualizes the findings and highlights meaningful relationships between attributes.

## ETL Process

### Extract
- **Data Source**: Heart disease diagnostic database.
- **Description**: Extracted data includes patient details, heart disease rates, gender, age, and other relevant attributes.

### Transform
- **Data Cleaning**: Managed missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data formats.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as heart disease rates by gender and age groups.

### Load
- **Destination**: Loaded transformed data into a database or data warehouse for further analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Used for data extraction, transformation, and EDA.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning. [Learn Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/).
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations. [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/).
  - **Matplotlib**: For data visualization. [Matplotlib guide](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html).
  - **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization. [Seaborn tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations. [Power BI resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/).

## Analysis

### Key Metrics
- **Heart Disease Rates**: Analyzed rates of heart disease across different demographics.
- **Heart Disease by Gender**: Compared heart disease rates between male and female populations.
- **Heart Disease by Age**: Examined heart disease prevalence across various age groups.
  
### Key Findings
- Identified significant trends and factors contributing to heart disease.
- Found relationships between heart disease, gender, and age.
- Provided insights for better future preparation and health interventions.
